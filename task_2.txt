 Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:-

 Objects:
     * It is a collection of related properties and methods.
     * A property is an association between a key and a value. eg: {name:"John",age:30}
     * Methods are functions associated with objects.
     * JavaScript objects provide a flexible and efficient way to store and access data

Internal Representation of JavaScript object:

1. JavaScript objects use a hash table-like structure internally.
   - Internally, JavaScript objects are represented using hash tables .
   - This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

2. Keys are strings, and values can be any valid JavaScript data type.
   - Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs.
   - The keys are typically strings, and the values can be any JavaScript data type 
     eg arrays, functions, etc.

3. Fast access and manipulation.
   - JavaScript objects provide fast access and manipulation of data.
   - The underlying hash table structure enables quick retrieval of values associated with keys.


Hash tables:-
    - It  provide a fast and efficient way to store and retrieve data using keys. 
    - In a hashtable or hashmap , each key is associated with a unique integer called as Hash Code / Index.
    - We can use the index to find the value in the table.It provides Id for each value in the table.
    - It can reduce storage and improve performance.
